## SDK:
If you want to use new features or get to know the SDK better, you can use this: http://sot-guide.igromanru.com

## Keybinds:
If you want to change keybinds use:  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes  
find interesting key `VK_` or `0x` code and put inside `Main.cpp` at correct place, eg.:  
`KeyToggle toggleF1(VK_F1);`  
replace to:  
`KeyToggle toggleF1(0x31);`  
to make F1 menu bootable by `1` instead of `F1`.
